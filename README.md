# Few Shot Learning        

Data limitation is a key concern for most public policy practioners. Due to resource limitations and privacy concerns, there is seldom enough data to incorporate most deep learning models. This tutorial serves as a guide for how even with limited data, and making use of Few Shot Learning (FSL), policy practioners can achieve similar (sometimes even better!) results than standard ML and DL based models. 

We provide a brief theoretical explanation for what FSL is and then introduce two practical demonstrations of models that utilize FSL, namely Mistral 7B (FSL with prompts) and SetFit (FSL without prompts). We compare both the computational intensity and model accuracy of these FSL models with more traditional Machine Learning (OneVsRestClassifier) and Deep Learning models (ClimateBert).
